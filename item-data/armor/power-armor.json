    "description": "The T-45 power armor was the first model deployed by the U.S. military before the Great War. Although bulky and relatively outdated by later standards, it revolutionized infantry combat during the Sino-American War. Often associated with the earliest Brotherhood of Steel expeditions, the T-45 remains a symbol of the pre-war military's technological leap.",
